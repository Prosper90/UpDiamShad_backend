post
https://api.staging.insightiq.ai/v1/social/contents/refresh
Refresh content items for a connected account for the default refresh period, which is T-90 days for content items. Once InsightIQ processes the request, you can fetch the updated content items by calling the retrieve content API.

Subscribe to the "CONTENTS.ADDED" and "CONTENTS.UPDATED" webhooks to receive a notification once the request is completed. With webhooks, you should use the retrieve content items in bulk API for optimal performance.
