post
https://api.staging.insightiq.ai/v1/social/content-groups/refresh
Refresh content groups for a connected account for the default refresh period, which is T-90 days for content groups. Once InsightIQ processes the request, you can fetch the updated content items by calling the retrieve content groups API.
